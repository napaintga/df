</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_when_use"></a>
When to use the BLE Middleware</h1>
<p>BLE is used in very low-power network and Internet of Things (IoT) solutions aimed for low-cost battery operated devices that can quickly connect and form simple wireless links. Target applications include HID, remote controls, sports and fitness monitors, portable medical devices and smart phone accessories, among many others that are being added to a long list of BLE supporting solutions.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_sig_adopted"></a>
SIG adopted Profiles and Services</h1>
<p>The BLE_PDL Component supports numerous SIG-adopted GATT-based Profiles and Services. Each of these can be configured for either a GATT Client or GATT Server. The Component generates all the necessary code for a particular Profile/Service operation, as configured in the Component Configure dialog.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_custom_profile"></a>
Custom Profiles</h1>
<p>You can create custom Profiles that use existing Services, and you can create custom Services with custom Characteristics and Descriptors.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_debug_support"></a>
Debug Support</h1>
<p>For testing and debugging, the Component can be configured to HCI mode through a Component-embedded UART. See General Tab - BLE Controller only (HCI over UART). For over-the-air verification, the Cypress CySmart Central Emulation Tool can be used for generic Bluetooth host stack emulation. To launch this tool, right-click on the Component and select Launch CySmart.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_architecture"></a>
BLE Middleware Architecture</h1>
<p>The BLE_PDL Component consists of the BLE Stack, BLE Profile, BLE_PDL Component Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), and the Link Layer. The following figure shows a high-level architecture of the BLE_PDL Component, illustrating the relationship between each of the layers and the route in which the application interacts with the Component. Note that the application is informed of the BLE events through the use of callback functions. You may build your state machine using these. Refer to the Callback Functions section for more details.</p>
<p> <style>div.image img[src="ble_architecture.png"]{width:613px;}</style>  </p><div class="image">
<img src="ble_architecture.png" alt="ble_architecture.png"/>
</div>
<p>The following sub-sections give an overview of each of these layers.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_stack"></a>
BLE Stack</h2>
<p>The BLE stack implements the core BLE functionality as defined in Bluetooth Core Specification 5.0. The stack is included as a precompiled library and is included in the BLE Middleware library. The BLE Stack implements the layered architecture of the BLE protocol stack as shown in the following figure.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="ble_stack.png" alt="ble_stack.png"/>
</div>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection_ble_stack_1"></a>
Generic Access Profile (GAP)</h3>
<p>The Generic Access Profile defines the generic procedures related to discovery of Bluetooth devices and link management aspects of connecting to Bluetooth devices. In addition, this profile includes common format requirements for parameters accessible on the user interface level.</p>
<p>The Generic Access Profile defines the following roles when operating over the LE physical channel:</p><ul>
<li><b>Broadcaster role</b>: A device operating in the Broadcaster role can send advertising events. It is referred to as a Broadcaster. It has a transmitter and may have a receiver.</li>
<li><b>Observer role</b>: A device operating in the Observer role is a device that receives advertising events. It is referred to as an Observer. It has a receiver and may have a transmitter.</li>
<li><b>Peripheral role</b>: A device that accepts the establishment of an LE physical link using any of the connection establishment procedures is termed to be in a "Peripheral role." A device operating in the Peripheral role will be in the "Slave role" in the Link Layer Connection State. A device operating in the Peripheral role is referred to as a Peripheral. A Peripheral has both a transmitter and a receiver.</li>
<li><b>Central role</b>: A device that supports the Central role initiates the establishment of a physical connection. A device operating in the "Central role" will be in the "Master role" in the Link Layer Connection. A device operating in the Central role is referred to as a Central. A Central has a transmitter and a receiver.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection_ble_stack_2"></a>
Generic Attribute Profile (GATT)</h3>
<p>The Generic Attribute Profile defines a generic service framework using the ATT protocol layer. This framework defines the procedures and formats of services and their Characteristics. It defines the procedures for Service, Characteristic, and Descriptor discovery, reading, writing, notifying, and indicating Characteristics, as well as configuring the broadcast of Characteristics. GATT Roles</p><ul>
<li><b>GATT Client</b>: This is the device that wants data. It initiates commands and requests towards the GATT Server. It can receive responses, indications, and notifications data sent by the GATT Server.</li>
<li><b>GATT Server</b>: This is the device that has the data and accepts incoming commands and requests from the GATT Client and sends responses, indications, and notifications to a GATT Client. The BLE Stack can support both roles simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection_ble_stack_3"></a>
Attribute Protocol (ATT)</h3>
<p>The Attribute Protocol layer defines a Client/Server architecture above the BLE logical transport channel. The attribute protocol allows a device referred to as the GATT Server to expose a set of attributes and their associated values to a peer device referred to as the GATT Client. These attributes exposed by the GATT Server can be discovered, read, and written by a GATT Client, and can be indicated and notified by the GATT Server. All the transactions on attributes are atomic.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection_ble_stack_4"></a>
Security Manager Protocol (SMP)</h3>
<p>Security Manager Protocol defines the procedures and behavior to manage pairing, authentication, and encryption between the devices. These include:</p><ul>
<li>Encryption and Authentication</li>
<li>Pairing and Bonding<ul>
<li>Pass Key and Out of band bonding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Key Generation for a device identity resolution, data signing and encryption</li>
<li>Pairing method selection based on the IO capability of the GAP central and GAP peripheral device</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection_ble_stack_5"></a>
Logical Link Control Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP)</h3>
<p>L2CAP provides a connectionless data channel. LE L2CAP provides the following features:</p><ul>
<li>Channel multiplexing, which manages three fixed channels. Two channels are dedicated for higher protocol layers like ATT, SMP. One channel is used for the LE-L2CAP protocol signalling channel for its own use.</li>
<li>Segmentation and reassembly of packets whose size is up to the BLE Controller managed maximum packet size.</li>
<li>Connection-oriented channel over a specific application registered using the PSM (protocol service multiplexer) channel. It implements credit-based flow control between two LE L2CAP entities. This feature can be used for BLE applications that require transferring large chunks of data.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection_ble_stack_6"></a>
Host Controller Interface (HCI)</h3>
<p>The HCI layer implements a command, event, and data interface to allow link layer access from upper layers such as GAP, L2CAP, and SMP.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="subsubsection_ble_stack_7"></a>
Link Layer (LL)</h3>
<p>The HCI layer implements a command, event, and data interface to allow link layer access from upper layers such as GAP, L2CAP, and SMP. The LL protocol manages the physical BLE connections between devices. It supports all LL states such as Advertising, Scanning, Initiating, and Connecting (Master and Slave). It implements all the key link control procedures such as LE Encryption, LE Connection Update, LE Channel Update, and LE Ping. The Link Layer is a hardware-firmware co-implementation, where the key time critical LL functions are implemented in the LL hardware. The LL firmware maintains and controls the key LL procedure state machines. It supports all the BLE chip specific low-power modes. The BLE Stack is a pre-compiled library in the BLE_PDL Component. The appropriate configuration of the BLE Stack library is linked during a build process based on application. The BLE Stack libraries are ARM Embedded Application Binary Interface(EABI) compliant and they are compiled using ARM compiler version 5.03. The following table shows the mapping between the BLE Stack library to the user-configured Complete BLE Protocol mode or HCI mode. Refer to the <b>General Tab</b> section of <a href="http://www.cypress.com/documentation/component-datasheets/bluetooth-low-energy-blepdl">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE_PDL) Datasheet</a> for selection of stack configuration.</p>

<p>BLE Middleware Configuration mode and CPU Core parameters can be configured in the <a href="http://www.cypress.com/documentation/component-datasheets/bluetooth-low-energy-blepdl"><b>General Tab</b> of BLE Configuration Tool</a>.</p>
<p>There are two sets of libraries:</p><ul>
<li>"_gcc_" libraries are built with wchar_t typedef set to 32-bit.</li>
<li>"_mdk_" libraries are built with wchar_t set to 16-bit. <dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The "_gcc_" libraries are used for the IAR compiler.</dd></dl>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_profile_layer"></a>
Profile Layer</h2>
<p>In BLE, data is organized into concepts called Profiles, Services, and Characteristics.</p><ul>
<li>A <b>Profile</b> describes how devices connect to each other to find and use Services. It is a definition used by Bluetooth devices to describe the type of application and the general expected behavior of that device. See the to the <b>Component Parameters</b> section of <a href="http://www.cypress.com/documentation/component-datasheets/bluetooth-low-energy-blepdl">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE_PDL) Datasheet</a> for how to configure the BLE Middleware.</li>
<li>A <b>Service</b> is a collection of data entities called Characteristics. A Service is used to define a certain function in a Profile. A Service may also define its relationship to other Services. A Service is assigned a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). This is 16 bits for SIG adopted Services and 128 bits for custom Services. See the <b>GATT Settings Tab</b> section of <a href="http://www.cypress.com/documentation/component-datasheets/bluetooth-low-energy-blepdl">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE_PDL) Datasheet</a> for information about adding Services to a Profile.</li>
<li>A <b>Characteristic</b> contains a Value and the Descriptor that describes a Characteristic Value. It is an attribute type for a specific piece of information within a Service. Like a Service, each Characteristic is designated with a UUID; 16 bits for SIG adopted Characteristics and 128 bits for custom Characteristics. See the <b>GATT Settings Tab</b> section of <a href="http://www.cypress.com/documentation/component-datasheets/bluetooth-low-energy-blepdl">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE_PDL) Datasheet</a> for information about adding Characteristics and Descriptors. The following diagram shows the relationship between Profiles, Services, and Characteristics in a sample BLE heart rate monitor application using a Heart Rate Profile.</li>
</ul>
<p> <style>div.image img[src="ble_profiles.png"]{width:70%;}</style>  </p><div class="image">
<img src="ble_profiles.png" alt="ble_profiles.png"/>
</div>
<p>The Heart Rate Profile contains a Heart Rate Service and a Device Information Service. Within the Heart Rate Service, there are three Characteristics, each containing different information. The device in the diagram is configured as a Sensor role, meaning that in the context of the Heart Rate Profile, the device is a GAP Peripheral and a GATT Server. These concepts are explained in the <a class="el" href="page_ble_general.html#group_ble_stack">BLE Stack</a> description.</p>
<p>The Profile layer is generated by PSoC Creator using the parameter configurations specified in the GUI. The Profile implements the Profile specific attribute database and APIs required for the application. You can choose to configure the standard SIG adopted Profile and generate a design or define a Custom Profile required by an application. The GUI also allows import/export of a Profile design in XML format for Profile design reuse. In addition, the Bluetooth Developer Studio compliant XML format is available.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_hal"></a>
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)</h2>
<p>The HAL implements the interface between the BLE stack and the underlying hardware. This layer is meant for the stack only and it is not advisable to modify it.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_operation_flow"></a>
Operation Flow</h1>
<p>A typical application code consists of three separate stages: Initialization, Normal operation, and Low-power operation.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="ble_operation_flow.png" alt="ble_operation_flow.png"/>
</div>
<p>After initialization, the BLE Middleware enters normal operation and periodically enters various degrees of low-power operation to conserve power. Therefore, initialization should only happen at system power-up, and the BLE Middleware should operate between normal mode and low-power mode afterwards. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_system_init"></a>
System Initialization</h2>
<p>The initialization stage happens at system power-up or when waking from system hibernation. This stage sets up the platform and the BLE Middleware parameters. The application code should also start the Component and set up the callback functions for the event callbacks that will happen in the other modes of operation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_system_normal_operation"></a>
System Normal Operation</h2>
<p>Upon successful initialization of the BLE Middleware or hibernate wakeup sequence, the Component enters normal mode. Normal operation first establishes a BLE connection if it is not already connected. It should then process all pending BLE events by checking the stack status. This is accomplished by calling <a class="el" href="group__group__ble__common__api__functions.html#ga0f1982f915c28b0d5a317442bec9eafc" title="This function checks the internal task queue in the BLE Stack, and pending operation of the BLE Stack...">Cy_BLE_ProcessEvents()</a>. When all events have been processed, it can transmit any data that need to be communicated and enters low-power operation unless there is another pending event. In such a case, it should execute the normal operation flow again. Processing of BLE events should be performed at least once in a BLE connection event period. The BLE connection event is configured by the Central device while establishing a connection.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_system_lpm"></a>
System Low-power Operation</h2>
<p>When there are no pending interrupts in normal operation, the BLE Middleware should be placed in low-power mode. It should first enter Sleep mode. The BLE Middleware can enter either CPU sleep or deep sleep mode depending on the state of the BLE interface hardware. If an event happens at any time in low-power mode, it should re-enter normal operation. </p><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The MCU and BLE Sub-System (BLESS) have separate power modes and are able to go to different power modes independent of each other. The check marks in the following table show the possible combination of power modes of MCU and BLESS. </dd></dl>

</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_device_bonding"></a>
Device Bonding</h1>
<p>The BLE Middleware will store the link key of a connection after pairing with the remote device. If a connection is lost and re-established, the devices will use the previously stored key for the connection. The BLE stack will update the bonding data in RAM while the devices are connected. If the bonding data is to be retained during shutdown, the application can use <a class="el" href="group__group__ble__common__api__functions.html#ga778852ddcd6a37606668984aca7c3754" title="This function writes the new bonding data from RAM to the dedicated Flash location as defined by the ...">Cy_BLE_StoreBondingData()</a> API to write the bonding data from RAM to the dedicated Flash location, as defined by the BLE Middleware. Refer to the CE215121_BLE_HID_Keyboard code example for usage details.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_lfclk_conf"></a>
LFCLK Configuration for Deep Sleep Mode</h1>
<p>The LFCLK configuration affects the BLE Middleware's ability to operate in deep sleep mode. If the WCO or PILO are chosen as source clock, then the BLE Middleware CPU deep sleep mode is available for use. However, if the ILO is chosen, then the BLE Middleware cannot enter CPU deep sleep.</p>
<p>Refer to the <b>Advanced Tab</b> section of <a href="http://www.cypress.com/documentation/component-datasheets/bluetooth-low-energy-blepdl">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE_PDL) Datasheet </a> for information on how to enable low-power mode in the BLE Middleware.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The BLE middleware uses the LFCLK only during CPU deep sleep mode, so ILO inaccuracy does not affect BLE communication.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_lfclk_Pilo_conf"></a>
Configuring PILO for Deep Sleep Mode</h2>
<p>The BLE Middleware supports using the Precision ILO (PILO) (instead of the WCO) as the LF clock source.</p>
<p>Using the PILO has limitations:</p><ul>
<li>supports only a single connection</li>
<li>supports only the Peripheral/Slave role</li>
<li>not supported for preproduction hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the PILO as the LF clock source requires:</p><ul>
<li>initial trimming and measuring the step size of the PILO trimming before BLE start</li>
<li>setting the clock configuration of the BLE sub-system after BLE start Both actions must happen during every power-up to get closest to the target frequency.</li>

Multi-Connection Support</h1>
<p>The BLE Middleware supports up to four simultaneous Multi-Master Multi-Slave (MMMS) BLE connections in any combination of roles. For example, it can be a master of four slave devices (4M), a master of three slave devices and a slave of another device (3M1S), or a slave of four devices (4S), or any other combination. To configure the maximum number of BLE connections, refer to the <b>General Tab</b> section of <a href="http://www.cypress.com/documentation/component-datasheets/bluetooth-low-energy-blepdl">Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE_PDL) Datasheet</a>(Maximum number of BLE connections). The BLE Middleware supports a single instance of a GATT Server (single GATT database). The number of the Server instance field is always fixed to 1 in the BLE_PDL Configure dialog. You can add additional Services or a complete Server Profile to the existing Server tree and build a GATT database. This single GATT database is reused across all BLE connections. The BLE Middleware manages multiple CCCD values. The CCCD value for each active connection is unique.</p>
<p>The maximum number of CCCD storage SRAM data structures supported by the BLE Middleware is determined by the number of active BLE connections/links that you select. The BLE Middleware restores CCCD values in flash for each of the bonded devices while establishing a connection with a peer device.</p>
<p>Use the connection handle at the application level to manage the multi-connection. The connection handle (<a class="el" href="structcy__stc__ble__conn__handle__t.html">cy_stc_ble_conn_handle_t</a>) appears when the connection is established (as the event parameter of the <a class="el" href="group__group__ble__common__api__events.html#gga7c1ef7e6d246e0f3eb6c883e23d82b86aff4f3e61e6d3125ac81bf0c92be85ab5">CY_BLE_EVT_GATT_CONNECT_IND</a> event).</p>
<p>To work with a particular connection, BLE APIs (BLE Stack APIs, BLE Profile APIs) provide the parameter connHandle (e.g., Cy_BLE_BASS_SendNotification(<a class="el" href="structcy__stc__ble__conn__handle__t.html" title="Connection Handle. ">cy_stc_ble_conn_handle_t</a> connHandle,... ).) BLE events from the AppCallback function include a connHandle in eventParam structures to distinguish to which connection this event relates.

The user registers for a particular type of a callback and the BLE component will call that registered callback basing on the registered mask (Refer to the <a class="el" href="group__group__ble__common__api__functions.html#ga4f1bb36b7bd9cd99410c677a62da061e" title="This function registers a callback to expose BLE interrupt notifications to an application that indic...">Cy_BLE_RegisterInterruptCallback()</a> and <a class="el" href="group__group__ble__common__api__functions.html#ga9d1d62eec83ccdad2828712553359db8" title="This function un-registers callback which exposed BLE interrupt notifications to the application...">Cy_BLE_UnRegisterInterruptCallback()</a> APIs).

An application can use these interrupt callbacks to know when the RF activity is about to begin/end or when the BLE device changes its state from advertisement to connected, or when the BLESS transitions between active and low-power modes, etc. These BLESS real-tie states can be used to synchronize an application with the BLESS or prevent radio interference with other peripherals etc.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_lpm"></a>
Low-power Modes</h1>
<p>The BLE middleware automatically registers sleep and deep sleep callback functions. This functions requests the BLE Stack to put Bluetooth Low Energy Sub-System (BLESS) to low-power mode.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_ble_io_connections"></a>
External PA/LNA Support</h1>
<p>RF front ends come in a variety of combinations. The most popular and comprehensive RF front ends come with a built-in power amplifier (PA) in the transmit path, a low-noise amplifier (LNA) in the receive path, a transmit/receive bypass path to bypass both the PA and LNA, and RF switches to select between transmit, receive, and bypass paths. Some front ends support multiple antennas. Some front ends have a built-in low-pass filter after the power amplifier. The discrete front ends also have almost the same configuration.</p>

Chip Enable Signal</h2>
<p>This signal is needed to put the front end to sleep or in standby whenever there is no radio activity. The signal is ON when either PA control or LNA control is ON.</p>
<p>The polarity of this signal is configurable and can be set in the EXT_PA_LNA_CTRL register by <a class="el" href="group__group__ble__common__api__functions.html#ga0a3e12b0378b1a40083a591d18d9d9dd" title="This function controls the external Power Amplifier and Low Noise Amplifier outputs.

Tx ENABLE</h2>
<p>This signal is turned ON during transmission and turned OFF when not transmitting. This signal is active a little earlier than the actual start of transmission to allow for the time it takes for the Power amplifier to ramp up. This delay can be set in the EXT_PA_LNA_DLY_CNFG register.</p>
