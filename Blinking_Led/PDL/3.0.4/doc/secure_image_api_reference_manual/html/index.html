<div class="textblock"><p>Secure Image (SI) is a reference design for building a secure system in user Flash and RAM. Its main objectives are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate secure boot construction and how to preserve the chain of trust from ROM boot to Flash boot and finally to the first and second secure applications.</li>
<li>Secure System Calls (SysCall), which are special routines that execute out of ROM and can only be communicated via IPC requests.</li>
<li>Secure Crypto execution, which access the Crypto engine to perform Crypto routines via IPC requests.</li>
<li>Protection Unit configuration for establishing a secure system.</li>
</ul>
<p>To support these objectives, the secure image implements a security policy that adheres to the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protection Context (PC)=0 is the secure mode of operation. Only the designated secure core (CM0+) core and the Crypto core are allowed to be in PC=0 state.</li>
<li>The designated secure core (CM0+) and the Crypto core bus masters are the only entities that have full PC=0 bus accesses.</li>
<li>All requests for PC=0 operations by non-secure bus masters (such as the CM4 core or TC) are performed by initiating an IPC request to the secure processor (CM0+). The secure core then performs the requested operation in a secure environment and releases the IPC upon completion.</li>
<li>System Calls (SysCall), which execute out of ROM are performed in PC=0 environment.</li>
<li>All Crypto operations are performed in PC=0 environment. Critical MMIO registers and memory regions (RO and R/W) are protected using the appropriate protection units. These are configured to only allow PC=0 accesses to those resources.</li>
<li>Boundary checking is performed on the PC=0 operations according to a user defined blacklist. This allows requests to be filtered and allow PC=0 operations to be carried out only on the allowed regions.</li>
<li>IPC registers and referenced memory locations are intentionally left unprotected. These must be accessible to all bus masters and the strategy for protecting these is up to the client application.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="group_secure_image_configuration"></a>
Design Considerations</h1>
<p>This design is integrated into a PSoC Creator project called "secure_image", which is provided in the same directory hierarchy as this source file. The "secure_Image" project workspace also has a "user_app0" project, which is a sample user application that is validated by the secure image. The two applications are combined into a single hex file. Follow these instructions to get started:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy the entire "security" directory from the PDL installation to a local working directory. Open the PSoC Creator workspace located in the example directory.</li>
<li>Build "secure_image" project in PSoC Creator. At the end of the CM0+ build process, a postbuild script called "secure_image_postbuild.bat" will execute (refer to the project build settings). This process signs the CM0+ application with the digital signature and exports the shared symbols for "user_app0".</li>
<li>Build "user_app0" project in PSoC Creator. At the end of the CM4 build process, a postbuild script called "user_app0_postbuild.bat" will execute (refer to the project build settings). This process signs the combined CM0+ and CM4 application and then merges it with the CM0+ "secure_image". The final image and hex file are located in the "user_app0" CortexM4 directory.</li>
<li>Program the "user_app0" hex file on to the PSoC 6 device.</li>
<li>Observe the two LEDs toggling (P0.3 and P1.1). This shows that both the CM0+ and CM4 cores have successfully booted and passed the application unit tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If reverting the device to skip the secure boot process, remember to also erase the SFlash region. This can be done using PSoC Programmer.</p>
<p>Note: If using a miniprog/kitprog through PSoC Creator, attaching the debugger before the image validation (<a class="el" href="group__group__secure__image__functions__initialization.html#ga1d9df3739c936d9b5eb6734687c249bb" title="Validates the user image using SHA-256 and RSA-2048. ">Cy_SI_ValidateImage()</a>) completes will result in disconnection due to an SWD time-out event. You may work around this issue by either using a different debug probe or by running PSoC Creator via CMD with the -swdretry flag set.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_secure_image_build"></a>
Build Environment</h2>
<p>The secure image and the accompanying sample user application use custom linker scripts. These are designed to work with the default startup files provided by the PDL. For more information on the contents of these files, refer to the <a class="el" href="page_secure_image_linker_scripts.html">Linker Scripts</a> page. When revising these, also make the necessary changes in the addresses referenced in cy_si_config.h.</p>
<p>The design uses cymcuelftool.exe along with a couple of batch scripts (secure_image_postbuild.bat and user_app0_postbuild.bat). These are used to export secure image symbols, populate the security regions in the elf files and to perform elf file merges. Review the referenced paths in the batch scripts and verify that the correct tools are installed (objdump, readelf, OpenSSL v1.0.2) before proceeding.</p>
<p>Note that the secure image also contains a script (rsa_keygen.bat) for generating RSA-2048 public and private keys using OpenSSL. These can be found in the same directory as the postbuild batch scripts.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_secure_image_symbols"></a>
Symbol Export</h2>
<p>Symbols used in the secure image are exported out so that they can be referenced by user application(s). The user application must also be able to use the secure image as a library of secure routines. Two steps are taken to ensure this.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The linkers for the supported toolchains (GCC, ARMCC, IAR) are configured to keep symbols from the following entities: cy_crypto*, cy_si*. This allows all of the Crypto library and secure image specific code and symbols to be kept in the final image.</li>
<li>The export symbols are defined in cy_si_export_symbols.txt, which allow those listed to be exported out as assembly defines. This is accomplished by using the code sharing facility in the cymcuelftool. Refer to the accompanying batch scripts for the implementation.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_secure_image_gccbuild"></a>
GCC Considerations</h2>
<p>The GCC compiler in the "secure_image" PSoC Creator project is configured to generate function sections "-ffunction-sections". The GCC linker is configured to remove unused sections by using "-Wl,â€“gc-sections". The "secure_image" needs to export a number of symbols to be referenced in the "user_app0" project, however certain symbols get optimized out despite proper efforts in the linker script to keep them. To work around this problem, <a class="el" href="group__group__secure__image__functions__general.html#gaca84d645a1d0e3414f0d9f998a4579ed" title="Returns the version of the Secure Image. ">Cy_SI_GetVersion()</a>, <a class="el" href="group__group__secure__image__functions__general.html#ga64f1e2c56e77438bc4255fec63abcbcd" title="Get Security Key Address given the index. ">Cy_SI_GetSecureKeyAddr()</a>, cy_toc2 and cy_rtoc2 are deliberately referenced in an unreachable code. If your build environment differs, you may remove this code. Verify that both cy_toc2 and cy_rtoc2 symbols are kept in the generated elf files and that <a class="el" href="group__group__secure__image__functions__general.html#gaca84d645a1d0e3414f0d9f998a4579ed" title="Returns the version of the Secure Image. ">Cy_SI_GetVersion()</a> and Cy_SI_GetSecureKeyAddr symbols are kept in the exported assembly file.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="group_secure_image_mdkbuild"></a>
ARMCC (MDK) Considerations</h2>
<p>The ARMCC compiler for both "secure_image" and "user_app0" are configured to suppress the 1296 warning "--diag_suppress 1296". This warning is unavoidable as pointer to non-pointer casts are necessary in many places in this design (e.g protection unit configuration and IPC data). The ARMCC linker is also configured to suppress the warnings regarding unused sections in the linker scripts "--diag_suppress=L6314W,L6329W". This suppression can be removed if your project does not require the use of those unused sections.</p>
